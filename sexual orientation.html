    <h2>Sexual orientation </h2>
    <p>refers to a person’s “emotional, affectional and sexual attraction to…individuals of a different gender or the same gender or more than one gender.” International Commission of Jurists, Yogyakarta Principles on the Application of International Human Rights Law in relation to Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity (2007) (“Yogyakarta Principles”), Preamble. Heterosexuality, homosexuality and bisexuality are all sexual orientations. The terms lesbian, gay and bisexual also refer to an individual’s sexual orientation.
   <b>Sexual orientation:</b><br>
<u><b>Lesbian/Gay</b></u> — Individuals who are romantically, emotionally, and/or sexually attracted to the same sex/gender.
<u><b>Bisexual</b></u> — Individuals who are romantically, emotionally, and/or sexually attracted to multiple sexes/genders.
  </p>

<div class="content2">
     <h2>Gender identity</h2> 
     <p>refers to “each person’s deeply felt internal and individual experience of gender, which may or may not correspond with the sex assigned at birth.” See Yogyakarta Principles, Preamble. Many individuals identify as male or as female. However, some individuals may identify with a non-binary gender or with no gender at all. A person’s gender identity may be different than the gender that society might attribute to that person on the basis of external signifiers such as clothing or mannerisms.
  <b>Gender identity and expression:</b> 
  <br><u><b>Cisgender </b></u>— Individuals whose gender identity/expressions is similar to that typically associated with their assigned sex at birth.</b>
  <br><u><b>Transgender</b></u> — Individuals whose gender identity/expression is different from that typically associated with their assigned sex at birth.</b>
  <br><u><b>Transitioning </b></u>— When individuals begin to express their authentic gender, which differs from that typically associated with their assigned sex at birth. Individuals who are transitioning may express their gender identity through changes in clothes, hairstyle, and makeup/accessories and may undergo medical or surgical treatments.</b>
  <br><u><b>Two-Spirit</b></u> — Created specifically by and for some Native American communities. Native American people who (a) express their gender and/or sexual orientation in indigenous, non-Western ways, and/or (b) define themselves as LGBTQI in a native context. </b>
