        <h1>LGBTIQ+ INCLUSION</h1>
<p>Every young person, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity,<br>deserves equal access to opportunities and services and their safety should be protected. <br><br><br>
 
However, young people who identify as Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Intersex or<br>Questioning (LGBTIQ+) are among the most marginalised and excluded members of<br>society. They are particularly vulnerable to stigma, violence and discrimination, due to<br>their real or perceived sexual orientation and gender identity.<br><br><br>

This can have lasting consequences on their social and psychological health and have <br>substantial adverse effects on society as a whole.<br></p>

    <h1>The benefits of LGBTQ+ inclusion in the work place :)<br></h1>
<center><img src="xyz/inclusion3.jpeg" height="50%" width="50%"></center>
   <p>
    The benefits to an LGBTQ+ inclusive workplace extend beyond that of making<br> sure employees of all sexualities and gender expressions feel safe and valid,<br> though this is the primary reason. LGBTQ+ inclusive workplaces benefit<br> businesses too in terms of productivity and profitability<br><br>

A study in the US by Out Now titled ‘LGBT 2020 – LGBT Diversity Show Me the <br> Business Case’ found that the US economy could save $9 billion annually if <br>organisations implemented more effective inclusion policies for their LGBTQ+<br> staff. This is partially attributed to avoiding costs from stress and ill-health<br> associated with LGBTQ+ staff who need to hide their identity at work or <br>experience discrimination. The study also cited the customer loyalty and buying <br>power of the LGBTQ+ market. Additionally, customers are likelier to leave <br> businesses who have cases of discrimination made public.<br><br>

So, having robust inclusion strategies in place for LGBTQ+ staff make sense <br>from a business perspective as well as an ethical standpoint. This is because all<br> employees will feel less stressed and more productive as respected members of<br> a cohesive team.
